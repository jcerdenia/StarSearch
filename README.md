# StarSearch
This is a sample master-detail application that retrieves and displays the results of search query "star" from the iTunes API. 
The master page displays a list of iTunes tracks with minimal info. Clicking on an item opens a new page with more information about that specific item.

<b>Architecture</b><br>
The app uses the MVVM architectural pattern.

<b>Persistence</b><br>
The app uses different methods of data persistence. Short-term persistence is handled by ViewModels. 

Long-term persistence is achieved through SharedPreferences:
<ul>
  <li>The user's choice of how items are sorted (by relevance, title, genre, or price)</li>
  <li>The user's last viewed page â€” the app always opens with the most recently viewed page before it was last closed. If the app opens with the detail page, the last viewed item is loaded.</li>
  <li>A date in the list header of when the user last visited.</li>
</ul>

In addition to the above, I have implemented a caching system using a local database. Each time data is retrieved from the API, it is saved to the database and retrieved when the device is not connected to the internet.

The app assumes that data from the API can change at any time. My implementation automatically deletes any old items in the database that are not part of a more recently retrieved list, ensuring that the database is always current. If the device has no internet connection, the most recent version of the data is still fed to the UI.
